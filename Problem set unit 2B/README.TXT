PROJECT TITLE: Problem set unit 2B
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE: Sep 21
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Eric Shen
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Part 1
Consider: I would create a new object, create a new name that equal to new OrderedPair to call the
        second constructor and assign (4.0, -5.0) in the actual parameter. The print out result would
        be some binary number represent the numbers we assigned.
        
Part 2
Consider: Now it would print out the right X and Y value. The numbers can be used in other functions,
        not limited in the single class.
